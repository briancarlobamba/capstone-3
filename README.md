# Capstone 3: Full-Stack E-commerce Application

## Overview
Capstone 3 is the continuation of the E-commerce API from Capstone 2, now extended into a full-stack application. This project demonstrates a complete online shopping platform, integrating both the back-end API with a front-end interface.

Created a fully functional e-commerce web application where users can browse products, register, log in, add items to a cart, and place orders. The front-end was built using React.js, providing a smooth user interface, while the back-end API handles product listings, user authentication, and order management. Integrated both the front-end and back-end, hosted on Vercel, to demonstrate my full-stack development skills, including API integration and managing data flow between the client and server.
